### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: What's in the song lyrics?
+ This project is conducted by Mengying Shi

+ Project summary: The objective of this project was to explore some characterstic in music lyrics over 4 decades of collected lyrics data which is a filtered corpus of 380,000+ song lyrics. In this project, I carry out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the corpus of song lyrics using tools from text mining,wordcloud and natural language processing such as sentiment analysis to explore some charactersitics of lyrics. This study showed that overal lyrics length is similar over all decades and different music genre express different sentiment. In addition, "LOVE","TIME","ILL" are some popular words of all the genres over all the time.
