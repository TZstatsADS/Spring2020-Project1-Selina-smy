### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by Mengying Shi

+ Project summary: Music lyrics penetrated into our lives and ubiquitously subtle influence our thoughts. Lyrics can take us back to a certain time when we were happy or sad while opening up our senses to be vulnerable. Lyrics on its own carries a certain amount of emotional weight. So,it's very interesting to look deeper into the patterns and characteristics of different types of song lyrics. What are the changes of lyrics from the past to now? What do the lyrics look like in different music genre? Are there some certain topics or sentiments for the lyrics? In this project, I carry out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the corpus of song lyrics using tools from text mining and natural language processing such as sentiment analysis to explore some charactersitics of lyrics.
